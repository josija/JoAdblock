# Jo Adblock Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 27, 2025**

## Introduction

Jo Adblock ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension collects, uses, and protects your information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any user data.**

Jo Adblock is designed with privacy as a core principle. The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and does not:

- Collect personally identifiable information
- Track your browsing history
- Store data on external servers
- Transmit data to third parties
- Use analytics or tracking services
- Monitor user activity
- Capture screenshots or page content

## Data Storage

All extension data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage:

- **chrome.storage.sync**: Stores user preferences (ad blocking settings, whitelist URLs)
- **chrome.storage.session**: Stores temporary session data (live ad counter, which resets when browser closes)

This data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.

## What We Do

Jo Adblock's sole purpose is to block advertisements and intrusive content. The extension:

- Blocks ads, pop-ups, and trackers on visited websites
- Stores user preferences locally (whitelist entries, blocking settings)
- Maintains a local counter of blocked ads
- Processes all functionality client-side without external communication

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services, analytics tools, advertising networks, or data processors.

## Permissions Explained

The extension requires the following permissions:

- **storage**: To save your blocking preferences and whitelist settings locally
- **activeTab**: To access current tab information to display statistics
- **declarativeNetRequest**: To block ad network requests at the network level
- **Host permissions**: To inject content scripts that identify and remove ad elements

These permissions are used solely for ad blocking functionality and are not used to collect or transmit data.

## Children's Privacy

Jo Adblock is not directed toward individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Data Security

Since we do not collect or transmit any data, there are no external data security concerns. All extension data is stored securely using Chrome's built-in storage mechanisms.

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- You can disable the extension at any time
- You can clear all stored data by removing the extension
- All data is stored locally on your device
- No data is transferred to external servers

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
